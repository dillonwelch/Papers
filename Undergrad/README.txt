Class Writings: These are various assignments I had to do for a class that were not as in depth as a research paper. Mostly consists of book analyses.

Research Papers and Reports: These are more detailed assignments than the Class Writings folder. Among other things are several history reports (Teutonic Knighs, Crossbow/Longbow, and Development of Mathematics), a technical report, a CD analysis, and a Senior Thesis. These all show an ability to research a topic and make an argument based around a particular thesis. Finally, if you want a laugh, read the Noam Chomsky paper.

Note: All the papers are uploaded as PDFs to eliminate formatting issues. To view them, click on "View Raw" and the PDF will download to your computer.
